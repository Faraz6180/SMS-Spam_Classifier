SMS Spam Classifier
Overview
The SMS Spam Classifier project uses machine learning techniques to classify text messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The model leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as text preprocessing, stopword removal, lemmatization, and stemming to clean the data before applying machine learning models for classification. This project aims to build a system that can automatically detect spam messages in SMS text data, which is crucial for filtering unwanted content in messaging applications.
